# ‚öôÔ∏è maze-solver project is a guided project from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-maze-solver-python) - an educational backend developement platform.

## The main goal of this project is to get familiar with the basic concepts I learned on the platform üìö, such as writing code with Python, using the built-in GUI library tkinter, and understanding algorithms.

### The application: 
- draws a maze using the tkinter graphical library,\

- solves a maze by using the dfs algorithm,
- animates the solution,\

- written in Python.
